Development hints:

- typescript is used to translate files to javascript
- npm is used to install needed dependencies
- grunt is used to build everything
- Visual Studio Code can be used for editing

- how to install?
	- install Visual Studio code
	- install some special build tools (windows only, installs Visual Studio Build and Python)
		- open elevated shell/powershell
		- run "npm install --global --production windows-build-tools"
			(this is needed for the node-gyp package which is needed by the grunt-contrib-compress package which is needed for the grunt build
			see also https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
	- install needed node packages
		- open shell at project dir or open terminal in visual studio code
		- run "npm install"
		- if this fails on windows because of node-gyp then you should again use an elevated terminal (because the install of grunt-contrib-compress will build something on the fly with Visual Studio build)
	- now you should be able to build with grunt and/or visual studio code

- how to install a new npm/grunt module?
	npm install MODULENAME --save-dev
		- it will refresh package.json und package-lock.json
		- it wil install the module under node_modules (which is excluded from git)

- directory structure
	src/sharedAll - contains sources used by *all* scripts
	src/sharedWebextension - contains all sources used by the webextension scripts
	src/options - contains the sources for the option page
		uses sharedAll and sharedWebextension
	src/backgroundScript - contains the sources for the backgroundScript
		uses sharedAll and sharedWebextension
	src/webexperiment - contains the sources for the webexperiment API
		uses sharedAll
	src/resources - contains all files that are needed additionally
