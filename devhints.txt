Development hints:

- typescript is used to translate files to javascript
- npm is used to install needed dependencies
- grunt is used to build everything
- Visual Studio Code can be used for editing

- how to install?
	- install Visual Studio code
	- install some special build tools (windows only, installs Visual Studio Build and Python)
		(I think with the current node installer this step is no longer needed, as the installer installs the build tools if you tick the checkbox at install)
		- open elevated shell/powershell
		- run "npm install --global --production windows-build-tools"
			(this is needed for the node-gyp package which is needed by the grunt-contrib-compress package which is needed for the grunt build
			see also https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
	- install needed node packages
		- open shell at project dir or open terminal in visual studio code
		- run "npm install"
		- if this fails on windows because of node-gyp then you should again use an elevated terminal (because the install of grunt-contrib-compress will build something on the fly with Visual Studio build)
	- now you should be able to build with grunt and/or visual studio code

- how to install a new npm/grunt module?
	npm install MODULENAME --save-dev
		- it will refresh package.json und package-lock.json
		- it will install the module under node_modules (which is excluded from git)

- module system
	Typescript code uses import/export statements (except the hand-written Thunderbird d.ts files, they are only imported via /// <reference path)
	The code is translated from typescript to Js and then packed with webpack to single js files including all needed modules.
- directory structure
	src/sharedAll - contains sources used by *all* scripts
	src/sharedWebextension - contains all sources used by the webextension scripts
	src/options - contains the sources for the option page
		uses sharedAll and sharedWebextension
	src/backgroundScript - contains the sources for the backgroundScript
		uses sharedAll and sharedWebextension
	src/webexperiment - contains the sources for the webexperiment API (stuff which is not yet supported by the webextension api)
		uses sharedAll
	src/resources - contains all files that are needed additionally
